3. For basic Javascript question I usually go to W3 Schools.
A promise is “a proxy for a value that will eventually become available.” It is also a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It gives us a way to handle asynchronous processing in a more synchronous fashion. To create a promise, you can use the ‘new Promise’ constructor, which accepts a handler that is given two functions as parameters. The first handler is to call the future value when it’s ready, while the second one is a function to call to reject the Promise if it can’t resolve the future value.

Git mergetool gets launched to show merges on my computer. 
It automatically edits text and when you exit it saves.
